# CycleNet
**This repository is still actively under construction!**

This is the official implementation of:

CycleNet: Rethinking Cycle Consistency in Text-Guided Diffusion for Image Manipulation  
Sihan Xu*, Ziqiao Ma*, Yidong Huang, Honglak Lee, Joyce Chai  
University of Michigan, LG AI Research  
NeurIPS 2023

### [Project Page](https://cyclenetweb.github.io) | [Paper (coming soon)]() | [ManiCups Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sled-umich/ManiCups)

## Conda Environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate cycle
```

## Training

This implementation builds upon [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet).  
Please redirect to this document on how to [train the model](./docs/train.md).
